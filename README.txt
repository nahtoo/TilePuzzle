Python Packages Required:
* numpy

To run solver:

	python3 puzzleSolver.py <A> <N> <H> <INPUTFILEPATH> <OUTPUTFILEPATH>

where A is the algorithm (A=1 for A* and A=2 for RBFS), N is the size of puzzle (N=3 for 8-puzzle and N=4 for 15-puzzle), H is for heuristics (H=1 forh1and H=2 forh2), INPUTFILEPATH and OUTPUTFILEPATH are the input and output filenames.
